## [2026-05-06] - <commit-hash>

### Phase QQ — DB cleanup: stale page_keys + ministry orphan fields
- Deleted 36 rows for decommissioned Phase Z filter routes (blog.cat.*, blog.tag.*, blog.author.ydm-admin, events.cat.*, sermons.cat.*, team.cat.*). Pages were removed in Phase Z but DB rows lingered.
- Deleted 130 orphan field_key rows on ministries.* pages that weren't read by the ministry template (h3.0N, p.01–p.08, image.0N + .alt + .url variants, slug, date_published, h1.01). Public-facing rendering byte-identical to post-Phase-OO baseline; admin editor /content list is now cleaner for the upcoming copy pass.
- Keep-list verified against MinistryTemplate.tsx + lib/ministries.ts: body_html, meta.title, hero_image, tagline, leader_name, leader_role, leader_bio (plus four future-proof entries that don't exist on ministries.* today).
- Pre-deletion snapshot saved to /tmp/ydm-prompt3/pre-cleanup-snapshot.json (untracked, available for manual rollback if needed).

### Phase PP — Shop checkout disabled pending Stripe verification
- /shop/[slug] buy button(s) replaced with a disabled "Currently unavailable" state and explanatory subtext.
- /shop landing banner added: "Our online shop is taking a brief pause while we finalize payment setup."
- /api/shop/checkout returns 503 at handler entry, gated on SHOP_CHECKOUT_ENABLED env var.
- Vercel Production env requires SHOP_CHECKOUT_ENABLED=false manually set; Preview/Dev unaffected.
- Stripe live-mode flip (originally Prompt 2 of audit fix sequence) deferred until Bishop Wilson completes Stripe business verification.

## [2026-05-06] - <commit-hash>

### Phase OO — Ministry page H3 fixes + demo footer strip
- Fixed H3 heading on 4 ministry pages where heading text didn't match the page topic: ask-bishop, family, outreach, wordwide.
- Stripped trailing demo footer block (Lake Building / Redding CA address from cmsmasters Faith Connect WP theme) from 6 ministry pages: ask-bishop, family, leadership, outreach, partnership, wordwide.
- leadership and partnership H3s left untouched (topically correct; pattern alignment deferred to copy pass).
- worship page already clean — no change.
- Body paragraphs under each H3 intentionally preserved; full rewrite deferred to Bishop's copy revision pass (see copy-pass-tracker.md).
- Migration applied via Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor; verified clean against rendered DOM on all 7 ministry pages.

### Phase NN — Shop UX polish
- feat(NN): product image lightbox — clicking the hero image OR clicking an already-selected color thumb opens a fullscreen overlay with prev/next/Esc keyboard nav, body-scroll lock, click-backdrop-to-close. Lightbox auto-syncs the selected variant when navigating between colors so closing leaves the user on the visual they last viewed.
- feat(NN): variant thumbs grid extended from 4 across to 6 across on desktop (more colors visible without scrolling); small "Tap a color to switch · double-tap or click hero to enlarge" hint added.
- chore(NN): "How it works" step 3 changed `Printful prints and ships directly to you` → `Your item is custom made and ships directly to you` per Mikey's polish pass.
- fix(NN): `lib/printful.ts` filter changed from `!is_ignored` to `synced > 0`. Root cause of "only 4 products showing on /shop" — the `is_ignored` flag was hiding products that legitimately belonged in the catalog. Now we filter only on whether variants are synced (no point showing an empty product).

### Phase MM — Handover docs
- docs(MM): `HANDOVER.md` (root) — comprehensive maintainer reference: every public + admin route, env var inventory, bishop's daily task playbook, post-handover setup checklist, troubleshooting, common-failure recipes
- docs(MM): `SMOKE_TEST.md` (root) — pre-handover verification checklist covering public-site walkthrough, admin walkthrough as both roles, email cutover sanity, Stripe + Shop happy paths (when accounts ready), auth flows
- docs(MM): `README.md` — added "Live at ydministries.ca" banner + maintainer pointers to HANDOVER + SMOKE_TEST + CHANGELOG
- docs(MM): `PROJECT.md` — refreshed "setting up" status to "live in production"; replaced stale outstanding-work checklist with operational items only; updated session log with all milestones through 2026-05-06

### Phase LL — Shop (Printful + Stripe)
- feat(LL): `lib/printful.ts` — env-gated wrapper for Printful Sync Products API. `listProducts()` / `getProductBySlug()` / `getProductById()` with Next.js fetch revalidation (5 min). `createPrintfulOrder()` for webhook-triggered fulfillment. Catalog NOT synced to Supabase — fetched at request time.
- feat(LL): `/shop` public catalog (hand-authored). 3-up grid with Printful thumbnails. Graceful empty states for "PRINTFUL_API_KEY unset" and "no products yet" — no broken-shop appearance.
- feat(LL): `/shop/[slug]` product detail page with image gallery (1 hero + 4 thumbs from variant preview files), variant select, and `BuyNow` client island that POSTs to `/api/shop/checkout`.
- feat(LL): `/api/shop/checkout` POST — validates variant against live Printful catalog (don't trust client price), creates Stripe Checkout Session in `mode='payment'` with shipping address collection enabled (CA/US/GB/AU/NZ), phone collection on. Metadata flags `ydm_kind='shop'` so the webhook can branch.
- feat(LL): `/api/stripe/webhook` extended — `checkout.session.completed` now branches on `ydm_kind`. Shop branch: insert into `orders` (status='paid', fulfillment_status='pending'), insert `order_items`, create Printful order via `createPrintfulOrder()`, update `printful_order_id` + fulfillment_status='submitted'. If Printful submission fails, fulfillment_status='submission_failed' and a `notes` field flags the orphan for manual reconcile. Donation branch (recurring) unchanged.
- feat(LL): `/shop/success` post-checkout success page — branded thank-you with link to keep shopping.
- feat(LL): `/admin/orders` admin browser — chronological table with payment status pill + fulfillment status pill. Top-of-page banner alerts admin when there are orphaned-paid orders that failed Printful submission. Bishop sees customer name + email + total + status; admin additionally sees printful_order_id.
- chore(LL): migration `20260506_shop_phase_ll.sql` adds `stripe_payment_intent_id`, `tracking_url`, `printful_recipient` (jsonb), `notes` columns to existing `orders` table from 004_shop scaffold; enables RLS on `orders` + `order_items` with admin/bishop SELECT (INSERT/UPDATE happen via service-role from webhook).
- chore(LL): `next.config.ts` adds Printful CDN hostnames (`files.cdn.printful.com`, `*.cdn.printful.com`, `*.printful.com`) to image remotePatterns.
- chore(LL): public site nav gains "Shop" link between Testimonies and Contact. Admin sidebar gains "Orders" link in both ADMIN_SIDEBAR and BISHOP_SIDEBAR.
- env: requires `PRINTFUL_API_KEY` plus the existing `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` + `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Without Printful key: catalog shows "Shop opening soon", routes still build, no errors. Without Stripe keys: BuyNow button hits 503 with a friendly message.
- v1 limitation noted: cart is single-quantity Buy Now (one product per checkout). Multi-item cart is v2.
- v1 limitation noted: Printful orders are created in DRAFT status (Bishop reviews + confirms in Printful dashboard). Auto-confirm can be flipped on later via Printful settings.

### Phase KK — Donations (Interac primary + Stripe recurring)
- feat(KK): completely redesigned `/give` page — two-column layout. LEFT: gold-bordered Interac e-Transfer card (primary path) with copy-paste-ready `donate@ydministries.ca`, 5-step instructions, "auto-deposit enabled" badge, zero-fees framing. RIGHT: Stripe Checkout recurring card with 4 preset tiers ($25/$50/$100/$250 monthly) + custom amount input ($5–$5000 range).
- feat(KK): `lib/stripe.ts` — env-gated `getStripe()` returns null when `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is unset; `isStripeConfigured()` + `DONATION_TIERS_CAD` constants. Pinned API version `2024-12-18.acacia`.
- feat(KK): `/api/donate/checkout` POST — creates Stripe Checkout Session in subscription mode with CAD currency, monthly recurring, billing-address collected, metadata propagated to subscription. Returns `{ url }` for client-side redirect.
- feat(KK): `/api/stripe/webhook` POST — verifies signature with `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, raw-body friendly. Handles `checkout.session.completed` (first month), `invoice.paid` (subsequent months, dedupes via `billing_reason='subscription_create'` skip), `invoice.payment_failed` (marks last donation row failed), `customer.subscription.deleted` (logs cancel marker).
- feat(KK): `_helpers/StripeRecurringForm.tsx` client component — preset tier buttons + custom-amount input, honeypot, validates 5–5000 CAD range, redirects to Stripe Checkout URL on submit.
- feat(KK): `/give/thanks` post-Checkout success page — branded "Your monthly partnership has begun" confirmation with sermon CTA. Stripe handles receipt email; we just acknowledge.
- feat(KK): `/admin/donations` browser — chronological ledger of Stripe donations with totals (active monthly partners count + total $ received). Bishop sees donor name + amount + date + status; admin additionally sees stripe_subscription_id. Note: Interac e-Transfer gifts aren't tracked here (they land in the donate@ inbox).
- chore(KK): admin sidebar gains "Donations" link in both ADMIN_SIDEBAR and BISHOP_SIDEBAR.
- chore(KK): migration `20260506_donations_phase_kk.sql` adds `stripe_subscription_id`, `stripe_customer_id`, `method` (with check constraint), `updated_at` columns to existing `donations` table from 004_shop scaffold; adds RLS for admin/bishop SELECT (INSERT/UPDATE happen via service-role from server-side). Additive ALTER — no DROP since the existing schema is mostly correct and table is empty.
- env: requires `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Gracefully degrades when unset — Stripe card shows "Coming soon" placeholder, Interac path stays fully functional.

### Phase JJ — Curated testimonials (replaces guestbook)
- feat(JJ): `testimonials` Supabase table — name + message + relationship + visitor_email + status (pending/approved/rejected) + is_featured + metadata + created_at/updated_at. RLS: anon INSERT (status=pending only), public SELECT for status=approved, admin/bishop SELECT all + UPDATE + DELETE.
- feat(JJ): `lib/testimonials.ts` — `getApprovedTestimonials()` (featured first, then date desc) and `getAllTestimonialsForAdmin()` (pending oldest-first, approved newest, rejected last).
- feat(JJ): `/testimonials` public page (hand-authored, NOT codegen) — hero, optional featured section with gold-bordered large card, 3-up grid for non-featured, submission form below. Empty state encourages first submission.
- feat(JJ): `_helpers/TestimonialForm.tsx` client component — name + relationship + email (hidden) + message, honeypot, character count, submit/success/error states.
- feat(JJ): `/api/testimonials/submit` POST — honeypot + validate + insert with status='pending' + email-notify bishop with link to moderation queue.
- feat(JJ): `/admin/testimonials` moderation — three sections (Pending review / Live / Rejected) with per-row Approve, Reject, Reopen, Feature/Unfeature, Delete actions. Pending count badge surfaces on bishop landing card.
- feat(JJ): admin landing card "Testimonies" added with `${pending} to review` badge for bishop / `${pending} pending` for admin. Bishop view re-laid-out to lg:grid-cols-3 to fit the 5th card.
- feat(JJ): admin sidebar gains "Testimonies" link in both ADMIN_SIDEBAR (between Messages and Subscribers) and BISHOP_SIDEBAR.
- feat(JJ): public site nav gains "Testimonies" link between Events and Contact.
- chore(JJ): `/guestbook` → `/testimonials` 308 redirect added in next.config (replaces old unmoderated guestbook flow). Existing GuestbookTemplate stays as dead code (codegen will keep regenerating /guestbook/page.tsx; redirect wins; cleanup deferred).

### Phase II — Sermon series + scripture index
- feat(II): `/sermons/scripture` — public scripture index (NOT in route-map.json; hand-authored, codegen-skipped). Lists every Bible passage referenced across all sermons grouped by book → chapter → verse. Each entry shows the verse text (cached by Phase K), translation, and links to the sermon(s) that mentioned it. Same gold-accent / cream / display-font styling as other site pages.
- feat(II): `lib/scriptureIndex.ts` — `parseRef()` handles `Joshua 4:19-20` / `Matthew 16:18` / `Romans 12` / `1 Corinthians 13:1-3` shapes including leading-number books and common aliases (Psalm/Psalms, Song of Songs/Solomon). `BOOK_ORDER` is the canonical 66-book Protestant ordering used for sorting.
- feat(II): `getScriptureIndex()` aggregates refs across all sermons in one round-trip; same `ref` string from multiple sermons merges into one entry with multiple sermon links. Verse-range overlaps (e.g. `Joshua 4:17-20` vs `Joshua 4:19-20`) stay separate entries by design — preserves what each sermon actually quoted.
- feat(II): `lib/sermons.ts` — `SermonListItem` extends `RecentSermon` with `series` field. `getAllSermons()` now reads optional `series_name` page_content field. New `groupSermonsBySeries()` helper sorts named series alphabetically, standalone sermons last (rendered as "More Sermons" header).
- feat(II): `SermonsIndexTemplate` renders grouped or flat depending on whether any sermon has `series_name` set — fallback is flat view (current UX). When at least one series is assigned, all sermons render in series sections with "Series" eyebrow + series name as the section header.
- feat(II): "Browse by scripture →" link on `/sermons` hero pointing to the new index. Reverse "← Back to all sermons" link on the scripture index hero.
- note: no sermons have `series_name` seeded — bishop opts in via `/admin/content/sermons.<slug>` adding the `series_name` field whenever he wants to group sermons. Until then, the flat view (current UX) keeps rendering. Series feature is dormant-but-ready.

## [2026-05-05] - 5c361bb

### Phase HH — /admin/users invite UI
- feat(HH): `/admin/users` page (admin-only — bishop redirects to /admin) listing all editors with role pill + last-sign-in + joined date, plus a separate "Pending invites" section for unconfirmed accounts
- feat(HH): invite form posts to `inviteUserAction` server action — calls `auth.admin.inviteUserByEmail()` with redirectTo `/admin/auth/reset`, then UPDATEs the auto-created profile row to admin if requested (default bishop). Branded YDM-gold invite email arrives via Resend SMTP.
- feat(HH): per-row `RoleSelect` client component auto-submits on change (server action handles the UPDATE), `Revoke` button calls `deleteUserAction` (deletes profile + auth user). Both server-side guards prevent self-demotion / self-deletion.
- feat(HH): `Cancel invite` action on pending invites — uses the same delete path
- feat(HH): 5th branded auth email template `docs/auth-email-templates/invite-user.html` — gold accent, "You're invited" eyebrow, "Set up my account" CTA, deep-links to `/admin/auth/reset?token_hash=...&type=invite`
- feat(HH): `/admin/auth/reset` now handles `type=invite` in addition to `type=recovery` — same UX (set a password) with adapted headline ("Welcome to YDM admin" vs "Set a new password")
- fix(HH): reset page now robust to three landing flows — (1) query-param `?token_hash=…&type=…` from branded templates, (2) URL-hash `#access_token=…&type=…` from default templates / verify-endpoint redirects, (3) existing session. Prior implementation only handled (1) and silently failed (1) when SSR client raced the useEffect. Added explicit hash parsing → `setSession()` for (2), and an `onAuthStateChange` listener with 3s timeout for the race window.
- chore(HH): admin landing's Users card flipped from "Coming soon" → live (links to `/admin/users`); admin sidebar gains a Users entry between Assets and Profile (bishop sidebar unchanged — Users is admin-only)
- ops(HH): requires the `Invite User` template to be pasted into Supabase Dashboard (Auth → Email Templates) with subject `You're invited to manage the YDM website` for the branded email to fire

### Phase EE — Resend Auth SMTP + branded auth emails + password reset + signup lockdown
- security(EE): removed public Sign Up tab from /admin/login. The previous tab let anyone create a `bishop`-role profile (via the on_auth_user_created trigger) and gain content-edit access — gap closed at the UI layer.
- security(EE): paired with toggling off "Allow new users to sign up" in Supabase Auth settings (Dashboard) — defense in depth at the API layer too. Direct calls to `auth.signUp()` are now rejected.
- security(EE): /admin/login now only offers Sign In + Forgot password. Footer card directs would-be users to email yeshuawebmaster@gmail.com for invitation. New editors are added by Mikey via Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users → Invite User (sends a magic link via the new branded SMTP) or via direct SQL with service-role.
- security(EE): error param surfaced on /admin/login if /admin/auth/callback bounces with a verifyOtp failure — no silent dead-ends.
- feat(EE): `/admin/auth/reset` client page — handles both URL-hash recovery flow (legacy Supabase `#access_token=…&type=recovery`) AND token-hash query flow (`?token_hash=…&type=recovery` from our branded templates), shows a "set new password" form, redirects to /admin on success, friendly error message for expired/used links
- feat(EE): `/admin/auth/callback` route now handles `?token_hash=…&type=signup|magiclink|email_change` via `verifyOtp` in addition to the existing OAuth `?code=…` PKCE flow — branded YDM email templates can now use the canonical callback for everything except recovery (which deep-links to /admin/auth/reset)
- feat(EE): 4 branded auth email templates saved to `docs/auth-email-templates/` (confirm-signup, magic-link, reset-password, change-email) — gold accent rule, cream bg, "YESHUA DELIVERANCE MINISTRIES" heading, matches newsletter welcome email styling. Templates are version-controlled here as source of truth; live copies live in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Emails.
- feat(EE): templates use `{{ .SiteURL }}/admin/auth/{callback,reset}?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=…` instead of `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}` so deep-links work without needing Site URL changes — recovery goes straight to the password form, signup confirmation lands on /admin
- chore(EE): /admin/login forgot-password handler now redirects to `/admin/auth/reset` (was `/admin/login` which silently dropped the recovery hash)
- ops(EE): Resend wired as Supabase Auth SMTP provider via Dashboard → Auth → SMTP Settings (host: smtp.resend.com, port 465, user: `resend`, password: existing RESEND_API_KEY, sender: noreply@ydministries.ca). Fixes silent-drop / 4-emails-per-hour bottleneck on Supabase's default SMTP that prevented bishop signup confirmation from arriving.

### Phase DD — Bishop Mode dashboard
- feat(DD): role-aware admin landing — bishop sees 4 plain-language cards (Edit pages / Messages / Newsletter / Photos) with friendly framing + a "click pencil to edit live" tip card; admin keeps the technical 6-card view including Profile + Users (soon)
- feat(DD): role-aware sidebar — bishop labels (Home / Edit pages / Messages / Newsletter / Photos / My account) vs admin labels (Dashboard / Content / Messages / Subscribers / Assets / Profile)
- feat(DD): `/admin/messages` — server-rendered form_submissions browser, filter chips by type (contact / prayer / ask / guestbook) with live counts, message-card list with name + email + category + truncated body, mailto reply button, admin-only failed-send badge + error-string surface
- feat(DD): `/admin/subscribers` — newsletter_subscribers browser, filter chips (active / unsubscribed / all), table with email + status pill + source (admin only) + signup date + per-row Remove/Re-add buttons (server actions); CSV export route at `/admin/subscribers/export?status=...`
- feat(DD): `getCurrentProfile()` non-throwing helper in `lib/apiAuth.ts` (sibling to `requireAdmin`/`requireBishop`) — for layouts/landing that branch on role rather than gate on it
- chore(DD): server actions return Promise&lt;void&gt; per React form-action contract; revalidatePath on the subscribers list refreshes the table after Remove/Re-add

## [2026-05-05] - b910970

### Phase CC — Newsletter signup
- feat(CC): `newsletter_subscribers` Supabase table — email (unique), status (subscribed/unsubscribed/bounced), source, unsubscribe_token (uuid default), resend_contact_id, resend_audience_id, metadata jsonb. RLS: anon INSERT, admin/bishop SELECT+UPDATE; service-role bypass for the unsubscribe flow.
- feat(CC): `lib/newsletter.ts` — Resend Audience integration (contacts.create/update via SDK 6.12.2), brand-styled welcome HTML email, bishop-notify helper, plausible-email validator, unsubscribe URL builder.
- feat(CC): `/api/newsletter/subscribe` POST — honeypot + validate + upsert (re-subscribe path supported) + push to Resend Audience + welcome email + bishop notification, all best-effort with the DB row as source of truth.
- feat(CC): `/api/newsletter/unsubscribe/[token]` GET — service-role flip to status='unsubscribed', sync to Resend, render inline brand-styled confirmation page (success / already / invalid / error).
- feat(CC): wire `NewsletterForm` (was preventDefault stub) — submitting / success / error states, accessible (sr-only label, aria-describedby, role=alert), honeypot field, disabled-during-submit.
- env: requires `RESEND_NEWSLETTER_AUDIENCE_ID` (graceful skip if unset — DB still works, audience push is the only thing that no-ops). Live audience: `a9fd8c6e-cedf-4e72-ab09-ac8db579fea8`.
- chore(CC): subscribe route uses service-role (was anon during initial implementation). Anon RLS only grants INSERT but PostgREST upsert needs INSERT + UPDATE + RETURNING — anon's UPDATE branch silently failed. Service-role mirrors the existing unsubscribe pattern; route-level honeypot + email validation are the gatekeeper.
- chore(CC): migration replaces a pre-existing empty `newsletter_subscribers` table from the orphaned `003_domain_tables.sql` scaffold — `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS … CASCADE` then `CREATE TABLE` (no `IF NOT EXISTS`) so the schema is authoritative, not idempotent.

## [2026-05-05] - 04e31d3

### Phase AA — Photo Gallery
- feat(AA): GalleryTemplate — masonry grid (CSS columns, 4-col desktop / 2 tablet / 1 mobile, 10px gap mirroring the live elementor config) + lightbox client component (`_helpers/GalleryGrid.tsx`)
- feat(AA): lightbox supports prev/next, keyboard nav (← → Esc), touch swipe, body-scroll lock, focus-visible ring, click-backdrop-to-close, position counter (n / N), per-photo caption
- feat(AA): `lib/gallery.ts` — getAllGalleryPhotos() reads `assets` rows where asset_key LIKE 'gallery.image.%', ordered ASC for stable curated sequence
- chore(AA): seeded 14 gallery photos into Supabase `assets` (asset_key = `gallery.image.01..14`) from the live elementor masonry widget; all images already on R2 (verified against media-manifest.json)
- chore(AA): registered `gallery` in templateRegistry.byKey; gallery is now the last route to graduate from per-key dump fallback (46/46 live routes templated)
- note: photos are currently demo-theme stock (CMSMasters Faith Connect); bishop will replace via /admin/assets — alt + caption are admin-editable per-asset

## [2026-05-05] - f84d3cd

### Phase Z — decommission index_filter stubs
- chore(Z): codegen-pages.ts now skips `type: "index_filter"` routes entirely (no more "Filtered list — wiring in Phase H" stubs)
- chore(Z): deleted 18 generated stub pages across 5 trees: `(site)/{category,tag,author,sermons-category,cmsms_profile_category}` and `(site)/events/category`
- .codegen-manifest.json count: 64 → 46 (drops the 18 index_filter entries)
- Behavior preserved: legacy WP filter URLs still 308-redirect to canonical indexes (`/blog?category=…`, `/blog?tag=…`, `/blog?author=…`, `/sermons?category=…`, `/events?category=…`, `/team?category=…`) via existing next.config siteMap entries
- Note: query-param filtering on the canonical index pages is intentionally NOT wired — most filter slugs have no underlying data (sermons/events/team have no category field; blog categories don't match the WP slugs). Filter URLs render the unfiltered index, which is acceptable for archive URLs that nobody links to internally
- 18 `*.cat.*`/`*.tag.*`/`*.author.*` page_content rows in Supabase remain as meta-only seed (per memory entry "intentionally meta-only"); admin can still edit their meta titles for SEO if filtering is wired in a future phase

### Phase Q — About / Contact / Live / Prayer templates
- feat(Q): AboutTemplate — 6-section about page (hero, story split, mission/vision/values, leaders teaser, locations teaser, gold CTA band)
- feat(Q): ContactTemplate — FOM-style 2-col layout (info column with icon-square rows + branded YDM card on left, ContactForm on right) with 14-reason optgroup select, dynamic placeholder, per-reason success messages
- feat(Q): LiveTemplate — full-bleed hero, 16:9 YouTube live-stream iframe (`UC7JM1kSVzeKSJ5MmiHIE7IA` / `@YDMWorldwide`), schedule band, subscribe CTA, catch-up link
- feat(Q): PrayerTemplate — hero, intro, mailto form (5 reasons + 3 sharing options), privacy card, give/contact CTAs
- feat(Q): `_helpers/MailtoForm.tsx` (generic, used by PrayerTemplate) + `_helpers/ContactForm.tsx` (controlled-state, FOM-style, used by ContactTemplate)
- feat(Q): registered all 4 templates in `byKey` of `templateRegistry`; codegen rewired `(site)/about|contact|live|prayer/page.tsx` as thin shims
- chore(Q): manual-seed entries for about (13 fields), contact (7), live (10), prayer (8 new merged with 9 existing) — 38 net-new rows after `seed:fixups:commit`
- chore(Q): updated `global.social.youtube` from `@BishopHuelWilson` → `@YDMWorldwide` (DB-only, REST PATCH)
- fix: `lib/blog.ts` filters non-canonical image hosts (CMSMasters demo URLs would crash `<Image>`); prefers seeded `hero_image` over scraped `image.01`

## [2026-05-04] - 8cf7d0d

### Phase N — remaining per-type + index templates
- feat(N): BlogTemplate, EventTemplate, CampaignTemplate, LocationTemplate registered in template registry by type
- feat(N): index templates for blog, events, give, ministries, sermons, team registered by page key
- feat(N): lib accessors for blog, campaigns, events, locations (parallel to ministries/sermons/team)
- chore(N): refactor 17 generated `(site)/*` pages to delegate to template registry (374 + / 419 -)
- chore: ignore `.vercel/` in `site/.gitignore`
- chore: seed-fixups + manual-seed.json adjustments

---

## [2026-04-26] - 045acb2

### Codegen + content infrastructure
- feat(F+G): codegen rewrite — 64 pages bound to route-map.json keys + seeded field_keys; per-key dump fallback for routes without templates
- feat(G): global page seed (18 rows: site identity, SEO defaults, contact, social, footer)
- chore(G): wipe 38 stale generated pages from old key/route namespace
- fix(G.1): script TS types (PostgrestFilterBuilder thenable, contentRoot xml variant)
- chore(I.7): wipe mangled WP nav-block row from home page_content
- fix(I.7): trailing-slash redirects via next.config (52 user redirects + Next auto)
- fix(I.8): normalize dedupe (case + smart quotes + dashes), fix "Minstries"/"WIlson" typos

### Site shell + brand
- feat(H): SiteHeader + SiteFooter + Tailwind v4 brand tokens + base typography
- feat(J.5a): real YDM brand — gold cross+globe logo (auto-traced SVG with continuous-spin animation), Bebas Neue + Barlow + Lora + Abuget self-hosted fonts, navy/gold/cream palette sampled from live ydministries.ca CSS

### HomeTemplate (full rebuild matching live site)
- feat(J): template-registry architecture + HomeTemplate v1
- feat(J.5b-d): hero with worship-pose photo + navy floating service card, FOUNDED IN FAITH split, Mission/Vision/Values 3-col, dark YDM Ministries with real leader photos (extracted via WP XML postmeta), Upcoming Events with date squares, dark Featured Sermons, live Countdown to next 4th Sunday, Meet Our Leaders with bishop+clementina portraits, Get Involved 4-up + gallery strip, Support Mission photo band, Newsletter
- feat(J.5e): 7 new ministry leader photos uploaded to R2 from WP XML _thumbnail_id postmeta
- feat(J.5f): carousel arrows on Ministries + Sermons sections, Welcome band image collage, Get Involved gallery strip
- patch: nav reorganization (Home preserved per elder-friendly UX), section reordering (sermons before events, get involved before give), spinning logo in hero, dark sections gold divider, polish on cursive accents

### Per-type page templates
