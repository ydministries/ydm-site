## [2026-05-06] - <pending>

### Phase JJ — Curated testimonials (replaces guestbook)
- feat(JJ): `testimonials` Supabase table — name + message + relationship + visitor_email + status (pending/approved/rejected) + is_featured + metadata + created_at/updated_at. RLS: anon INSERT (status=pending only), public SELECT for status=approved, admin/bishop SELECT all + UPDATE + DELETE.
- feat(JJ): `lib/testimonials.ts` — `getApprovedTestimonials()` (featured first, then date desc) and `getAllTestimonialsForAdmin()` (pending oldest-first, approved newest, rejected last).
- feat(JJ): `/testimonials` public page (hand-authored, NOT codegen) — hero, optional featured section with gold-bordered large card, 3-up grid for non-featured, submission form below. Empty state encourages first submission.
- feat(JJ): `_helpers/TestimonialForm.tsx` client component — name + relationship + email (hidden) + message, honeypot, character count, submit/success/error states.
- feat(JJ): `/api/testimonials/submit` POST — honeypot + validate + insert with status='pending' + email-notify bishop with link to moderation queue.
- feat(JJ): `/admin/testimonials` moderation — three sections (Pending review / Live / Rejected) with per-row Approve, Reject, Reopen, Feature/Unfeature, Delete actions. Pending count badge surfaces on bishop landing card.
- feat(JJ): admin landing card "Testimonies" added with `${pending} to review` badge for bishop / `${pending} pending` for admin. Bishop view re-laid-out to lg:grid-cols-3 to fit the 5th card.
- feat(JJ): admin sidebar gains "Testimonies" link in both ADMIN_SIDEBAR (between Messages and Subscribers) and BISHOP_SIDEBAR.
- feat(JJ): public site nav gains "Testimonies" link between Events and Contact.
- chore(JJ): `/guestbook` → `/testimonials` 308 redirect added in next.config (replaces old unmoderated guestbook flow). Existing GuestbookTemplate stays as dead code (codegen will keep regenerating /guestbook/page.tsx; redirect wins; cleanup deferred).

### Phase II — Sermon series + scripture index
- feat(II): `/sermons/scripture` — public scripture index (NOT in route-map.json; hand-authored, codegen-skipped). Lists every Bible passage referenced across all sermons grouped by book → chapter → verse. Each entry shows the verse text (cached by Phase K), translation, and links to the sermon(s) that mentioned it. Same gold-accent / cream / display-font styling as other site pages.
- feat(II): `lib/scriptureIndex.ts` — `parseRef()` handles `Joshua 4:19-20` / `Matthew 16:18` / `Romans 12` / `1 Corinthians 13:1-3` shapes including leading-number books and common aliases (Psalm/Psalms, Song of Songs/Solomon). `BOOK_ORDER` is the canonical 66-book Protestant ordering used for sorting.
- feat(II): `getScriptureIndex()` aggregates refs across all sermons in one round-trip; same `ref` string from multiple sermons merges into one entry with multiple sermon links. Verse-range overlaps (e.g. `Joshua 4:17-20` vs `Joshua 4:19-20`) stay separate entries by design — preserves what each sermon actually quoted.
- feat(II): `lib/sermons.ts` — `SermonListItem` extends `RecentSermon` with `series` field. `getAllSermons()` now reads optional `series_name` page_content field. New `groupSermonsBySeries()` helper sorts named series alphabetically, standalone sermons last (rendered as "More Sermons" header).
- feat(II): `SermonsIndexTemplate` renders grouped or flat depending on whether any sermon has `series_name` set — fallback is flat view (current UX). When at least one series is assigned, all sermons render in series sections with "Series" eyebrow + series name as the section header.
- feat(II): "Browse by scripture →" link on `/sermons` hero pointing to the new index. Reverse "← Back to all sermons" link on the scripture index hero.
- note: no sermons have `series_name` seeded — bishop opts in via `/admin/content/sermons.<slug>` adding the `series_name` field whenever he wants to group sermons. Until then, the flat view (current UX) keeps rendering. Series feature is dormant-but-ready.

### Phase HH — /admin/users invite UI
- feat(HH): `/admin/users` page (admin-only — bishop redirects to /admin) listing all editors with role pill + last-sign-in + joined date, plus a separate "Pending invites" section for unconfirmed accounts
- feat(HH): invite form posts to `inviteUserAction` server action — calls `auth.admin.inviteUserByEmail()` with redirectTo `/admin/auth/reset`, then UPDATEs the auto-created profile row to admin if requested (default bishop). Branded YDM-gold invite email arrives via Resend SMTP.
- feat(HH): per-row `RoleSelect` client component auto-submits on change (server action handles the UPDATE), `Revoke` button calls `deleteUserAction` (deletes profile + auth user). Both server-side guards prevent self-demotion / self-deletion.
- feat(HH): `Cancel invite` action on pending invites — uses the same delete path
- feat(HH): 5th branded auth email template `docs/auth-email-templates/invite-user.html` — gold accent, "You're invited" eyebrow, "Set up my account" CTA, deep-links to `/admin/auth/reset?token_hash=...&type=invite`
- feat(HH): `/admin/auth/reset` now handles `type=invite` in addition to `type=recovery` — same UX (set a password) with adapted headline ("Welcome to YDM admin" vs "Set a new password")
- fix(HH): reset page now robust to three landing flows — (1) query-param `?token_hash=…&type=…` from branded templates, (2) URL-hash `#access_token=…&type=…` from default templates / verify-endpoint redirects, (3) existing session. Prior implementation only handled (1) and silently failed (1) when SSR client raced the useEffect. Added explicit hash parsing → `setSession()` for (2), and an `onAuthStateChange` listener with 3s timeout for the race window.
- chore(HH): admin landing's Users card flipped from "Coming soon" → live (links to `/admin/users`); admin sidebar gains a Users entry between Assets and Profile (bishop sidebar unchanged — Users is admin-only)
- ops(HH): requires the `Invite User` template to be pasted into Supabase Dashboard (Auth → Email Templates) with subject `You're invited to manage the YDM website` for the branded email to fire

## [2026-05-05] - 9420372

### Phase EE — Resend Auth SMTP + branded auth emails + password reset + signup lockdown
- security(EE): removed public Sign Up tab from /admin/login. The previous tab let anyone create a `bishop`-role profile (via the on_auth_user_created trigger) and gain content-edit access — gap closed at the UI layer.
- security(EE): paired with toggling off "Allow new users to sign up" in Supabase Auth settings (Dashboard) — defense in depth at the API layer too. Direct calls to `auth.signUp()` are now rejected.
- security(EE): /admin/login now only offers Sign In + Forgot password. Footer card directs would-be users to email yeshuawebmaster@gmail.com for invitation. New editors are added by Mikey via Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users → Invite User (sends a magic link via the new branded SMTP) or via direct SQL with service-role.
- security(EE): error param surfaced on /admin/login if /admin/auth/callback bounces with a verifyOtp failure — no silent dead-ends.
- feat(EE): `/admin/auth/reset` client page — handles both URL-hash recovery flow (legacy Supabase `#access_token=…&type=recovery`) AND token-hash query flow (`?token_hash=…&type=recovery` from our branded templates), shows a "set new password" form, redirects to /admin on success, friendly error message for expired/used links
- feat(EE): `/admin/auth/callback` route now handles `?token_hash=…&type=signup|magiclink|email_change` via `verifyOtp` in addition to the existing OAuth `?code=…` PKCE flow — branded YDM email templates can now use the canonical callback for everything except recovery (which deep-links to /admin/auth/reset)
- feat(EE): 4 branded auth email templates saved to `docs/auth-email-templates/` (confirm-signup, magic-link, reset-password, change-email) — gold accent rule, cream bg, "YESHUA DELIVERANCE MINISTRIES" heading, matches newsletter welcome email styling. Templates are version-controlled here as source of truth; live copies live in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Emails.
- feat(EE): templates use `{{ .SiteURL }}/admin/auth/{callback,reset}?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=…` instead of `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}` so deep-links work without needing Site URL changes — recovery goes straight to the password form, signup confirmation lands on /admin
- chore(EE): /admin/login forgot-password handler now redirects to `/admin/auth/reset` (was `/admin/login` which silently dropped the recovery hash)
- ops(EE): Resend wired as Supabase Auth SMTP provider via Dashboard → Auth → SMTP Settings (host: smtp.resend.com, port 465, user: `resend`, password: existing RESEND_API_KEY, sender: noreply@ydministries.ca). Fixes silent-drop / 4-emails-per-hour bottleneck on Supabase's default SMTP that prevented bishop signup confirmation from arriving.

### Phase DD — Bishop Mode dashboard
- feat(DD): role-aware admin landing — bishop sees 4 plain-language cards (Edit pages / Messages / Newsletter / Photos) with friendly framing + a "click pencil to edit live" tip card; admin keeps the technical 6-card view including Profile + Users (soon)
- feat(DD): role-aware sidebar — bishop labels (Home / Edit pages / Messages / Newsletter / Photos / My account) vs admin labels (Dashboard / Content / Messages / Subscribers / Assets / Profile)
- feat(DD): `/admin/messages` — server-rendered form_submissions browser, filter chips by type (contact / prayer / ask / guestbook) with live counts, message-card list with name + email + category + truncated body, mailto reply button, admin-only failed-send badge + error-string surface
- feat(DD): `/admin/subscribers` — newsletter_subscribers browser, filter chips (active / unsubscribed / all), table with email + status pill + source (admin only) + signup date + per-row Remove/Re-add buttons (server actions); CSV export route at `/admin/subscribers/export?status=...`
- feat(DD): `getCurrentProfile()` non-throwing helper in `lib/apiAuth.ts` (sibling to `requireAdmin`/`requireBishop`) — for layouts/landing that branch on role rather than gate on it
- chore(DD): server actions return Promise&lt;void&gt; per React form-action contract; revalidatePath on the subscribers list refreshes the table after Remove/Re-add

## [2026-05-05] - b910970

### Phase CC — Newsletter signup
- feat(CC): `newsletter_subscribers` Supabase table — email (unique), status (subscribed/unsubscribed/bounced), source, unsubscribe_token (uuid default), resend_contact_id, resend_audience_id, metadata jsonb. RLS: anon INSERT, admin/bishop SELECT+UPDATE; service-role bypass for the unsubscribe flow.
- feat(CC): `lib/newsletter.ts` — Resend Audience integration (contacts.create/update via SDK 6.12.2), brand-styled welcome HTML email, bishop-notify helper, plausible-email validator, unsubscribe URL builder.
- feat(CC): `/api/newsletter/subscribe` POST — honeypot + validate + upsert (re-subscribe path supported) + push to Resend Audience + welcome email + bishop notification, all best-effort with the DB row as source of truth.
- feat(CC): `/api/newsletter/unsubscribe/[token]` GET — service-role flip to status='unsubscribed', sync to Resend, render inline brand-styled confirmation page (success / already / invalid / error).
- feat(CC): wire `NewsletterForm` (was preventDefault stub) — submitting / success / error states, accessible (sr-only label, aria-describedby, role=alert), honeypot field, disabled-during-submit.
- env: requires `RESEND_NEWSLETTER_AUDIENCE_ID` (graceful skip if unset — DB still works, audience push is the only thing that no-ops). Live audience: `a9fd8c6e-cedf-4e72-ab09-ac8db579fea8`.
- chore(CC): subscribe route uses service-role (was anon during initial implementation). Anon RLS only grants INSERT but PostgREST upsert needs INSERT + UPDATE + RETURNING — anon's UPDATE branch silently failed. Service-role mirrors the existing unsubscribe pattern; route-level honeypot + email validation are the gatekeeper.
- chore(CC): migration replaces a pre-existing empty `newsletter_subscribers` table from the orphaned `003_domain_tables.sql` scaffold — `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS … CASCADE` then `CREATE TABLE` (no `IF NOT EXISTS`) so the schema is authoritative, not idempotent.

### Phase AA — Photo Gallery
- feat(AA): GalleryTemplate — masonry grid (CSS columns, 4-col desktop / 2 tablet / 1 mobile, 10px gap mirroring the live elementor config) + lightbox client component (`_helpers/GalleryGrid.tsx`)
- feat(AA): lightbox supports prev/next, keyboard nav (← → Esc), touch swipe, body-scroll lock, focus-visible ring, click-backdrop-to-close, position counter (n / N), per-photo caption
- feat(AA): `lib/gallery.ts` — getAllGalleryPhotos() reads `assets` rows where asset_key LIKE 'gallery.image.%', ordered ASC for stable curated sequence
- chore(AA): seeded 14 gallery photos into Supabase `assets` (asset_key = `gallery.image.01..14`) from the live elementor masonry widget; all images already on R2 (verified against media-manifest.json)
- chore(AA): registered `gallery` in templateRegistry.byKey; gallery is now the last route to graduate from per-key dump fallback (46/46 live routes templated)
- note: photos are currently demo-theme stock (CMSMasters Faith Connect); bishop will replace via /admin/assets — alt + caption are admin-editable per-asset

### Phase Z — decommission index_filter stubs
- chore(Z): codegen-pages.ts now skips `type: "index_filter"` routes entirely (no more "Filtered list — wiring in Phase H" stubs)
- chore(Z): deleted 18 generated stub pages across 5 trees: `(site)/{category,tag,author,sermons-category,cmsms_profile_category}` and `(site)/events/category`
- .codegen-manifest.json count: 64 → 46 (drops the 18 index_filter entries)
- Behavior preserved: legacy WP filter URLs still 308-redirect to canonical indexes (`/blog?category=…`, `/blog?tag=…`, `/blog?author=…`, `/sermons?category=…`, `/events?category=…`, `/team?category=…`) via existing next.config siteMap entries
- Note: query-param filtering on the canonical index pages is intentionally NOT wired — most filter slugs have no underlying data (sermons/events/team have no category field; blog categories don't match the WP slugs). Filter URLs render the unfiltered index, which is acceptable for archive URLs that nobody links to internally
- 18 `*.cat.*`/`*.tag.*`/`*.author.*` page_content rows in Supabase remain as meta-only seed (per memory entry "intentionally meta-only"); admin can still edit their meta titles for SEO if filtering is wired in a future phase

### Phase Q — About / Contact / Live / Prayer templates
- feat(Q): AboutTemplate — 6-section about page (hero, story split, mission/vision/values, leaders teaser, locations teaser, gold CTA band)
- feat(Q): ContactTemplate — FOM-style 2-col layout (info column with icon-square rows + branded YDM card on left, ContactForm on right) with 14-reason optgroup select, dynamic placeholder, per-reason success messages
- feat(Q): LiveTemplate — full-bleed hero, 16:9 YouTube live-stream iframe (`UC7JM1kSVzeKSJ5MmiHIE7IA` / `@YDMWorldwide`), schedule band, subscribe CTA, catch-up link
- feat(Q): PrayerTemplate — hero, intro, mailto form (5 reasons + 3 sharing options), privacy card, give/contact CTAs
- feat(Q): `_helpers/MailtoForm.tsx` (generic, used by PrayerTemplate) + `_helpers/ContactForm.tsx` (controlled-state, FOM-style, used by ContactTemplate)
- feat(Q): registered all 4 templates in `byKey` of `templateRegistry`; codegen rewired `(site)/about|contact|live|prayer/page.tsx` as thin shims
- chore(Q): manual-seed entries for about (13 fields), contact (7), live (10), prayer (8 new merged with 9 existing) — 38 net-new rows after `seed:fixups:commit`
- chore(Q): updated `global.social.youtube` from `@BishopHuelWilson` → `@YDMWorldwide` (DB-only, REST PATCH)
- fix: `lib/blog.ts` filters non-canonical image hosts (CMSMasters demo URLs would crash `<Image>`); prefers seeded `hero_image` over scraped `image.01`

## [2026-05-04] - 8cf7d0d

### Phase N — remaining per-type + index templates
- feat(N): BlogTemplate, EventTemplate, CampaignTemplate, LocationTemplate registered in template registry by type
- feat(N): index templates for blog, events, give, ministries, sermons, team registered by page key
- feat(N): lib accessors for blog, campaigns, events, locations (parallel to ministries/sermons/team)
- chore(N): refactor 17 generated `(site)/*` pages to delegate to template registry (374 + / 419 -)
- chore: ignore `.vercel/` in `site/.gitignore`
- chore: seed-fixups + manual-seed.json adjustments

## [2026-04-26] - 045acb2

### Codegen + content infrastructure
- feat(F+G): codegen rewrite — 64 pages bound to route-map.json keys + seeded field_keys; per-key dump fallback for routes without templates
- feat(G): global page seed (18 rows: site identity, SEO defaults, contact, social, footer)
- chore(G): wipe 38 stale generated pages from old key/route namespace

- feat(J.5e): 7 new ministry leader photos uploaded to R2 from WP XML _thumbnail_id postmeta
- feat(J.5f): carousel arrows on Ministries + Sermons sections, Welcome band image collage, Get Involved gallery strip
- patch: nav reorganization (Home preserved per elder-friendly UX), section reordering (sermons before events, get involved before give), spinning logo in hero, dark sections gold divider, polish on cursive accents

### Per-type page templates
- feat(K): SermonTemplate covers 6 sermon pages — hero with scripture cursive, custom audio player (±15s skip, scrubber, MM:SS), body prose with inline scripture-timestamp links, auto-extracted scripture cards (37 refs via regex + bible-api.com cached as JSON), related sermons, share buttons, back link
- feat(L): MinistryTemplate covers 7 ministry pages — hero with tagline cursive, leader card with initials avatar, body prose with .editable-prose defensive class, "Join This Ministry" gold CTA, related ministries
- feat(M): TeamTemplate covers 4 team pages (3 rendered + 1 redirect) — split portrait/bio hero, ministries-led grid, sermons-by-them dark band (Bishop only), connect CTA, related team
- chore(M): merge bishop duplicate routes — /team/bishopwilson 308-redirects to /team/bishop-huel-wilson via codegen redirectKeys

### Cleanups
- fix(K cleanup): strip WP share-widget SVGs and title-repeat h6s from sermon body_html (16,645 bytes saved)
- fix(L cleanup): strip CMSMasters demo theme img/figure tags from ministry body_html (20,263 bytes saved); strip "– YDM – Yeshua Deliverance Ministries" suffix from sermon + ministry meta.titles
